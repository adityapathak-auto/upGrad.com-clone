# Cloning upGrad.com:A functional and visual clone.

Through this blog, I am going to share my journey of working on a team project as a web developer student at Masai School.

So I had a problem statement that I have to create a clone of a website called upGrad[.com](https://relianceretail.com/index.html)  . Also I can use my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJs, NodeJs, EJS view engine and MongoDb Atlas knowledge.

On Monday, 17th of January, 2022 all the students at Masai school were divided into a team of four from their respective batches and assigned a project that they had to build within 1weeks, and on the last day, from every batch best teams would be selected to present their project to the respective Judges. We had to build the project with whatever skills we were taught in unit 1, unit 2 ,unit 3 and unit 4 at Masai school, so in my case, it was HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressJs, NodeJs, EJS view engine and MongoDb. I was assigned to team 16 and my teammates were Sarthak Bakshi, Ashutosh Swaraj and Aditya Pathak.

# Inputs for beginners-

This was the fourth project I worked on at Masai, and the things I’m going to share are stuff I realized, will benefit someone new to web development or who is going to work for the very first time on a project. So here it is.

# The outcome and important learning from the project :-

This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more such as we could have added timer and there were some more functionalities that could have been done, but yeah the time didn’t permitted us to go further. But we will surely improve it. If you want to look at the project then you can go to this GitHub and LinkedIn link :
